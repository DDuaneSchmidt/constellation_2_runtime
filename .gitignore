# Constellation 2.0 - repo hygiene (audit-grade)
# Rule: ignore build artifacts, virtualenvs, caches, and local outputs.
#
# IMPORTANT (C2 authority):
# - Runtime truth under constellation_2/runtime/truth/** is the authoritative immutable output surface
#   and MUST be trackable in git for reproducible, hash-verifiable replay.
# - Non-truth runtime outputs remain local by default.
#
# IMPORTANT (Derived artifacts):
# - Human-readable summaries derived from canonical truth are NON-authoritative operational conveniences.
# - They MUST NOT be committed. They are regenerated deterministically from canonical truth.
